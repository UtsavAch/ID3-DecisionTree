(This is how to calculate the information gain of numerical attribute for a given threshold)

Step1:- Calculate the parent entropy

Step2:- Split the dataset into two by the given threshold (<= threshold and > threshold)

Step3:- calculate the entropy of the two subsets

Step4:- Calculate the information gain of the attribute for the given threshold

        Info Gain = ParentEntropy - (sizeOfLeftSubset/TotalSize)*LeftEntropy - (sizeOfRightSubset/TotalSize)*RightEntropy



(Find the information gain for different thresholds, the threshold with highest info gain will be the info gain of the attribute)


####
How to find the thresholds?

Step1:- Sort the dataset based on the values of the numerical attribute

Step2:-For each pair of consecutive values, the potential threshold is computed as the average of these two values.
